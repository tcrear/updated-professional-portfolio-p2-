                    Hi, I'm Tammie. I was born and raised in Minnesota. Graduated from Winona State University in 2014 with a bachelors degree in Communication Studies and a minor in Sociology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My previous experience includes work in the financial and insurance industries providing customer service and product knowledge to internal and external stakeholders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I chose to leave the corporate world and follow my passion to learn coding after the pandemic gave me much needed time to explore the depths of my knowledge and where I wanted to learn more in technology.
                </p>

                        <p>The motivation of the project was to increase the readability of the site. The build addition was an update to the original HTML load that increased the adaptability of the site through refactoring and alt text. </p>

                        <p>Our project was focused on "The Movie Data Base" API results. The app is for a user to search popular movies to see what they may want to watch. It gives the rating, genre, release date, description and title of the movie. When you first get to the site you are presented with an option to select a genre and also sign up to be apart of the email club. When a genre is selected you are taken to another html which displays the ratings and movie attributes. You can go back to the home page with the back button and select a new genre.</p>

                        <p>This project was to create a daily planner to manage your work day. There are three color coding events to let you know what tasks are in the past, present, and future. The app also allows you to add and save tasks using your local storage.</p>
